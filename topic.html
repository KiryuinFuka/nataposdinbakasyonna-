                        <h2>What is a Motherboard?</h2>
                        <p>Alternatively called the mb, mainboard, mboard, mobo, mobd, backplane board, base board, main circuit board, planar board, system board, or a logic board on Apple computers.
                            The motherboard is a printed circuit board and foundation of a computer that is the biggest board in a computer chassis.</p>
                            
                        <p> It allocates power and allows communication to and between the CPU (central processing unit), RAM (random-access memory), and all other computer hardware components.
                            A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer, like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card. 
                            There are multiple types of motherboards, designed to fit different types and sizes of computers.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory, so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. 
                            However, hard drives are mostly universal and work with most motherboards, regardless of the type or brand.</p>

                        <h3>How does Motherboards work?</h3>
                        <p>A computer’s motherboard is typically the largest printed circuit board in a machine’s chassis. It distributes electricity and facilitates communication between and to the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and any other component of the computer’s hardware. There is a broad range of motherboards, each of which is intended to be compatible with a specific model and size of the computer.</p>

                        <h2>What is a CPU?</h2>
                        <p>The Central Processing Unit or CPU is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.” The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry that runs the machine’s operating system and apps.
                            The CPU interprets, processes and executes instructions, most often from the hardware and software programs running on the device.</p>

                        <p>The CPU performs arithmetic, logic, and other operations to transform data input into more usable information output. 
                            While the CPU must contain at least one processing core, many contain multiple cores. A server with two hexa-core CPUs, for example, will have a total of 12 processors.</p>

                        <h3>What does a CPU actually do?</h3>
                        <p>At its core, a CPU takes instructions from a program or application and performs a calculation. This process breaks down into three key stages: fetch, decode and execute. A CPU fetches the instruction from RAM, decodes what the instruction actually is, and then executes the instruction using relevant parts of the CPU.
                            The executed instruction, or calculation, can involve basic arithmetic, comparing numbers, performing a function, or moving numbers around in memory. Since everything in a computing device is represented by numbers, you can think of the CPU as a calculator that runs incredibly fast. The resulting workload might start up Windows, display a YouTube video, or calculate compound interest in a spreadsheet.

                        <p><b>Fetch</b> -  The CPU fetches instructions from the computer’s memory and stores them in a part of its control unit called the Instruction Register (IR).</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Decode</b> - The CPU sends the instruction from the IR to its instruction decoder. This combinatorial circuit decodes the instruction into signals.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Execute</b> - The decoded signals travel to relevant destinations in the CPU for the execution phase. </p>

                        <h2>What is a Ram?</h2>
                        <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. 
                            RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.</p>
                        
                        <p>Random Access Memory is volatile. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.</p>

                        <h3>How does RAM work?</h3>
                        <p>The term random access as applied to RAM comes from the fact that any storage location, also known as any memory address, can be accessed directly. Originally, the term Random Access Memory was used to distinguish regular core memory from offline memory.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Offline memory typically referred to magnetic tape from which a specific piece of data could only be accessed by locating the address sequentially, starting at the beginning of the tape. RAM is organized and controlled in a way that enables data to be stored and retrieved directly to and from specific locations.</p>

                        <h3>Two types of RAM</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>DRAM (pronounced DEE-RAM)</b> - it is widely used as a computer’s main memory. Each DRAM memory cell is made up of a transistor and a capacitor within an integrated circuit, and a data bit is stored in the capacitor. Since transistors always leak a small amount, the capacitors will slowly discharge, causing information stored in it to drain; hence, DRAM has to be refreshed (given a new electronic charge) every few milliseconds to retain data.</p>

                <div class="subtopic3-4">
                    <div class="stp3-4">
                    <p><b>SRAM (static RAM)</b> - it is a type of random access memory (RAM) that retains data bits in its memory as long as power is being supplied. Unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), which must be continuously refreshed, SRAM does not have this requirement, resulting in better performance and lower power usage. SRAM can be found in other devices ways as well. For example, SRAM chips are often used in cell phones, wearables and other consumer electronics. They might also be embedded in medical products, which can include anything from hearing aids to body area networks that include multiple devices embedded in the body.</p>
